# JavaScript Basics

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to understanding the basics of JavaScript, from variable declarations to advanced concepts like functions and arrays. It is designed for beginners who want to get a solid foundation in JavaScript programming.

## Contents

1. **Variable Declarations**  
   - `var` (Old method)  
   - `let` (Preferred for mutable variables)  
   - `const` (Preferred for immutable variables)  
   - Template literals using backticks (\`...\`).

2. **Data Types**  
   - Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Null, Undefined, and Objects.
   - Dynamically typed nature of JavaScript.

3. **Comparison Operators**  
   - Loose Equality (`==`) vs. Strict Equality (`===`).

4. **Functions**  
   - Function Declaration.  
   - Function Expression.  
   - Arrow Functions (Preferred).

5. **Arrays**  
   - Characteristics of JavaScript arrays.  
   - Different ways to create arrays.  
   - Accessing elements and basic array operations:
     - Adding elements (`push`, `unshift`).
     - Removing elements (`pop`, `shift`).
     - Finding an index (`indexOf`).
     - Checking if a value is an array (`Array.isArray`).

6. **Objects**  
   - Defining objects and accessing their properties.

7. **Other Concepts**  
   - The `Date` object for getting the current date and time.
   - Statically typed vs. Dynamically typed languages.
   - Type coercion in JavaScript.
